This is a code first approach mvc crud application. To run this, we need to follow the below steps:

Install the below packages from Nuget

1. Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
2. Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools

Since, DB entities already in model folder, then we can just add / update the DB connection string in appSetting.Json file
like below example:

"DbConnection": "Data Source=Your_DB_Server_Name;Initial Catalog=Your_DB_Name;Persist Security Info=True;User ID=DB_User_Name;Password=DB_Password;TrustServerCertificate=True;"

After, these all run the below command in "Package Manager Console"

1. Add-Migration "CreatedProductTable"
2. Update-Database

Once, these completed, check your database and check whether table is created or not
